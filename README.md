This was a personal project that I have undertaken in order to fully understant Heuler rotation matrixes and gain hands on experience on the live streaming of data from a mobile phone to the Matlab environment runnig on PC. The scripts collect data streamed from the phone (rotation along the axes) and replicate the rotations that the phone has on a matlab plot containing a 3d mesh i have done of my phone.This project was done in my last bachelor's year.

DURATION: 3 months
